    <h2> Attack </h2>
    <p> Mantis shrimps have two methods of attack; they can be <strong> spearers </strong> or <strong>smashers</strong>. 
    <br>They strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey, and can cause serious damage on victims larger than themselves.
  <h3> Eyesight </h3>
    <p>Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about independently of each other. They are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom. <br> The mantis shrimp has such good eyes that it can perceive both polarized light, and color vision outside the normal visual spectrum.
